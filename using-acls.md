# Setting up network ACLs
{: #setting-up-network-acls}
[comment]: # (linked help topic)

With the ACL functionality available in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Virtual Private Cloud, you can control all incoming and outgoing traffic related to your critical business workloads on the cloud. An ACL is a built-in, virtual firewall, similar to a security group. In contrast to security groups, ACL rules control traffic to and from the _subnets_, rather than to and from the _instances_.
{:shortdesc}

Newer generation available. For more information, see [Setting up network ACLs](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-acls) for generation 2 compute resources.
{:important}

For a comparison of the characteristics of security groups and ACLs, see the [comparison table](/docs/vpc-on-classic-network?topic=vpc-on-classic-network-compare-security-groups-and-access-control-lists).
{:note}

The example given in this document shows how to create network ACLs in your VPC using the CLI, which will protect your subnets.

## APIs and CLIs are available for ACLs
{: #apis-and-clis-are-available-for-acls}

You can set up and manage ACLs through the API, CLI, or UI.

* See the [API Reference](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/vpc-on-classic){: external} for the parameters, request body, and response details for each API.

* See this [CLI example](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-creating-a-vpc-using-the-ibm-cloud-cli) to get command details, steps for installing the CLI plugin, and the prerequisite steps of using the VPC CLI.

* See [Configuring the ACL using the UI](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-creating-a-vpc-using-the-ibm-cloud-console#configuring-the-acl) for information about how to set up ACLs in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

ACL rules control traffic to and from the _subnets_. It appears that the VPC API, CLI, and UI provide support to customize the **destination IP range** for inbound rules and **source IP range** for outbound rules, however these addresses are not customizable. **The destination IP range of inbound ACL rules and the source IP range of outbound ACL rules are each tied to the attached subnets**. Therefore, in practice, **0.0.0.0/0** should be used as the destination IP of inbound rules and source IP of outbound rules.
{: note}

## Working with ACLs and ACL rules
{: #working-with-acls-and-acl-rules}

To make your ACLs effective, you'll create rules that determine how to handle your inbound and outbound network traffic. You can create multiple inbound and outbound rules. See [Quotas](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-quotas) for specific information about how many rules you can create.

* With inbound rules, you can allow or deny traffic from a source IP range, with specified protocols and ports. The destination IP range is determined by the attached subnet.
* With outbound rules, you can allow or deny traffic to a destination IP range, with specified protocols and ports. The source IP range is determined by the attached subnet.
* ACL rules are considered in sequence. Rules with a greater priority number (such as 2) are evaluated only if rules with a lower priority number (such as 1) do not match.
* Inbound rules are separated from outbound rules.
* The protocols currently supported are TCP, UDP, and ICMP. You also can use the **all** option to designate _all_ or _other_ protocols (if a rule with a higher priority is specified).

For relevant information about using ICMP, TCP, and UDP protocols in your ACL rules, see [Understanding Internet Communication Protocols](/docs/vpc-on-classic-network?topic=vpc-on-classic-network-setting-up-network-acls#understanding-icp).

### Attaching an ACL to a subnet
{: #attaching-an-acl-to-a-subnet}

You have two options when attaching an ACL to a subnet:

* You can create a new subnet, and specify an ACL to attach. If you don't specify an ACL, a default network ACL is attached. The default ACL allows all inbound traffic destined for this subnet, and all outbound traffic from this subnet.
* You can attach an ACL to an existing subnet. If another ACL is attached to this subnet already, that ACL is detached before the new ACL is attached.

## ACL demo example
{: #acl-demo-example}

In the example that follows, you'll be able to create two ACLs and associate them with two subnets, using the command line interface (CLI). Here's what the scenario looks like:

![An example ACL scenario](images/vpc-acls.svg)

As the figure illustrates, you have two web servers dealing with requests from the Internet and two backend servers that you want to hide from the public. In this example, you place the servers into two separate subnets, 10.10.10.0/24 and 10.10.20.0/24 respectively, and you need to allow the web servers to exchange data with the backend servers. Also, you want to allow limited outbound traffic from the backend servers.

### Example rules
{: #acl-example-rules}

The example rules that follow show how to set up the ACL rules for a basic scenario as described previously.

As a best practice, it's recommended that you give fine-grained rules a higher priority than coarse-grained rules. For example, if you have a rule blocking all traffic from the subnet 10.10.30.0/24, and it is matched with a higher priority, the fine-grained rule with lower priority to allow traffic from 10.10.30.5 will never be applied.
{:note}

**ACL-1 example rules**:

| Inbound/Outbound| Allow/Deny | Source IP | Destination IP | Protocol | Port | Description|
|--------------|-----------|------|------|------|------------------|-------|
| Inbound | Allow | 0.0.0.0/0 | 0.0.0.0/0 | TCP| 80 | Allow HTTP traffic from the Internet|
| Inbound | Allow | 0.0.0.0/0 | 0.0.0.0/0 | TCP | 443 | Allow HTTPS traffic from the Internet|
| Inbound | Allow| 10.10.20.0/24 | 0.0.0.0/0 |all| all| Allow all inbound traffic from the subnet 10.10.20.0/24 where the backend servers are placed|
| Inbound | Deny| 0.0.0.0/0| 0.0.0.0/0 |all| all| Deny all other traffic inbound|
| Outbound | Allow | 0.0.0.0/0 | 0.0.0.0/0 | TCP|80 | Allow HTTP traffic to the Internet|
| Outbound | Allow | 0.0.0.0/0 | 0.0.0.0/0 | TCP|443 | Allow HTTPS traffic to the Internet|
| Outbound | Allow| 0.0.0.0/0 | 10.10.20.0/24 |all| all| Allow all outbound traffic to the subnet 10.10.20.0/24 where the backend servers are placed|
| Outbound | Deny| 0.0.0.0/0 | 0.0.0.0/0|all| all| Deny all other traffic outbound|


**ACL-2 example rules**:

| Inbound/Outbound| Allow/Deny | Source IP | Destination IP | Protocol| Port | Description|
|--------------|-----------|------|------|------|------------------|--------|
| Inbound | Allow| 10.10.10.0/24 | 0.0.0.0/0 |all| all| Allow all inbound traffic from the subnet 10.10.10.0/24 where the web servers are placed|
| Inbound | Deny| 0.0.0.0/0| 0.0.0.0/0 |all| all| Deny all other traffic inbound|
| Outbound | Allow | 0.0.0.0/0 | 0.0.0.0/0 | TCP| 80 | Allow HTTP traffic to the Internet|
| Outbound | Allow | 0.0.0.0/0 | 0.0.0.0/0 | TCP| 443 | Allow HTTPS traffic to the Internet|
| Outbound | Allow| 0.0.0.0/0 | 10.10.10.0/24 |all| all| Allow all outbound traffic to the subnet 10.10.10.0/24 where the web servers are placed|
| Outbound | Deny| 0.0.0.0/0 | 0.0.0.0/0|all| all| Deny all other traffic outbound|

This example illustrates general cases only. In your scenarios, you also may want to have more granular control over the traffic:

* You could have a network administrator who needs access to the 10.10.10.0/24 subnet from a remote network for operation purposes. In that case, you'll need to allow SSH traffic from the Internet to this subnet.
* You might want to narrow down the protocol scope that you allow between your two subnets.

### Example steps
{: #acl-example-steps}

The following example steps skip the prerequisite steps of using the CLI to create a VPC, which must be done first. For more information, see [Creating a VPC using the CLI](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-creating-a-vpc-using-the-ibm-cloud-cli).


#### Step 1. Create the ACLs
{: #step-1-create-the-acls}

Here are CLI commands you could use to create two ACLs, named `my_web_subnet_acl` and `my_backend_subnet_acl`:

```
ibmcloud is network-acl-create my_web_subnet_acl
ibmcloud is network-acl-create my_backend_subnet_acl
```
{: codeblock}

The response includes the newly created ACL IDs. Save the IDs of both ACLs to be used in later commands. You could use variables named `webacl` and `bkacl`, like this:

```
webacl="ba9e785a-3e10-418a-811c-56cfe5669676"
bkacl="a4e28308-8ee7-46ab-8108-9f881f22bdbf"
```
{: codeblock}

#### Step 2. Retrieve the default ACL rules
{: #step-2-retrieve-the-default-acl-rules}

Before adding new rules, retrieve the default inbound and outbound ACL rules so that you can insert new rules before them.

```
ibmcloud is network-acl-rules $webacl
ibmcloud is network-acl-rules $bkacl
```
{: codeblock}

The response shows the default inbound and outbound rules that allow all IPv4 traffic in all protocols.

```
{: screen}

Save the IDs of both ACL rules as variables, you'll use them in later commands. For example, you could use variables named `inrule` and `outrule`:

```
inrule="e2b30627-1a1d-447b-859f-ac9431986b6f"
outrule="173a3492-0544-472e-91c0-7828cbcb62d4"
```
{: codeblock}

#### Step 3. Add new ACL rules as described
{: #step-3-add-new-acl-rules-as-decribed}

This section shows adding inbound rules first, then adding outbound rules.

Insert new inbound rules before the default inbound rule.

```
ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add my_web_acl_rule200 $webacl deny inbound all 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 \
--before-rule $inrule
```
{: pre}

At each step, save the ID of the ACL rule in a variable, it will be used in later commands. For example, you could use the variable name `acl200`:

```
acl200="90930627-1a1d-447b-859f-ac9431986b6f"
```
{: pre}

Now add the rule to `acl200`:

```
ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add my_web_acl_rule100 $webacl allow inbound all 10.10.20.0/24 0.0.0.0/0 \
--before-rule $acl200
```
{: pre}

Add more rules until your ACL setup is complete, saving each ID as a variable.

```
acl100="78340627-1a1d-447b-859f-ac9431986b6f"
ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add my_web_acl_rule20 $webacl allow inbound tcp 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 \
--port-max 443 --port-min 443 --before-rule $acl100
acl20="32450627-1a1d-447b-859f-ac9431986b6f"
ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add my_web_acl_rule10 $webacl allow inbound tcp 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 \
--port-max 80 --port-min 80 --before-rule $acl20
```
{: codeblock}

Insert new outbound rules before the default outbound rule.

```
ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add my_web_acl_rule200e $webacl deny outbound all 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 \
--before-rule $outrule
acl200e="11110627-1a1d-447b-859f-ac9431986b6f"
ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add my_web_acl_rule100e $webacl allow outbound all 0.0.0.0/0 10.10.20.0/24 \
--before-rule $acl200e
acl100e="22220627-1a1d-447b-859f-ac9431986b6f"
ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add my_web_acl_rule20e $webacl allow outbound tcp 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 \
--port-max 443 --port-min 443 --before-rule $acl100e
acl20e="33330627-1a1d-447b-859f-ac9431986b6f"
ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add my_web_acl_rule10e $webacl allow outbound tcp 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 \
--port-max 80 --port-min 80 --before-rule $acl20e
```
{: codeblock}

#### Step 4. Create the two subnets with the newly created ACL
{: #step-4-create-the-two-subnets-with-the-newly-created-acl}

You'll create two subnets so that each of your ACLs is associated with one of the new subnets.

```
ibmcloud is subnet-create my_web_subnet my_VPC my_region --ipv4_cidr_block 10.10.10.0/24 \
--generation gc --network-acl $webacl
ibmcloud is subnet-create my_backend_subnet my_VPC my_region --ipv4_cidr_block 10.10.20.0/24 \
--generation gc --network-acl $bkacl
```
{: codeblock}

## Understanding Internet Communication Protocols
{:#understanding-icp}

Generally speaking, a _communication protocol_ is a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information. The internet has a large suite of protocols to cover many situations. In creating web-based applications and programming interfaces, software developers commonly utilize three of these communication protocols to describe the state of the network and the ways that data packets are moved across the network:

* ICMP, Internet Control Message Protocol, part of the internet protocol suite defined in RFC 792.
* TCP, Transmission Control Protocol
* UDP, User Datagram Protocol

The protocols that are used for a particular implementation of, say, an API call, can influence the overall behavior of your network, so it is worthwhile to understand the basic differences between them. If you need more information, many good articles are available on the internet with detailed descriptions of the protocols.

### ICMP
{:#network-infrastructure-icmp}

ICMP is a _control protocol_, meaning it is designed not to carry application data, but rather information about the status of the network itself. It is essentially a _network layer_ (OSI Layer-3) error-reporting and error-control protocol for the network. The best-known examples of ICMP in practice are the `ping` utility, which uses ICMP to probe remote hosts for responsiveness and overall round-trip time of the probe messages, and the `traceroute` utility.

What developers need to know is that ICMP packets have no TCP or UDP port numbers associated with them, because port numbers are a Layer-4 (_transport layer_) construct.

### TCP and UDP
{:#network-infrastructure-tcp-udp}

Both Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are OSI Layer-4 _transport protocols_; they are used to pass the actual data. The main difference between TCP and UDP, from a developer's perspective, is how they handle **packet order**.

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, it guarantees that all sent packets will reach the destination in the correct order.

UDP, on the other hand, is a connection-less protocol. Communication is datagram-oriented, so the integrity is guaranteed only on the single datagram. Datagrams reach a destination and can arrive out of order, or possibly they don't arrive at all.

UDP  generally is used for real-time communication, where a little percentage of the packet loss rate is preferable to the overhead of a TCP connection.

### Additional information
{:#network-infrastructure-additional-information}

An overview of the OSI 7-layer model with examples of internet protocols at each layer is available [here](https://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/OSI_Layers.asp).
