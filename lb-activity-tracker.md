# Activity tracker integration
{: #activity-tracker-integration}

The load balancer service is integrated with IBM Cloud Activity Tracker with LogDNA, which records events, in a manner compliant with the CADF standard, as triggered by user-initiated activities that change the state of the service in the cloud.
{:shortdesc}

For a list of actions that are recorded as auditing events on the load balancer service instances, see [Activity tracker with LogDNA events](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-at-events#events-load-balancers).

All auditing events are recorded to IBM Cloud Activity Tracker with LogDNA in the `us-south` region, regardless in which region the load balancer service is provisioned.

To view events, you must provision an "IBM Cloud Activity Tracker with LogDNA" instance in the`us-south` region under your account. Users in your account must have an IAM policy that grants the **Viewer** platform access role and **Reader** service access role on the IBM Cloud Activity Tracker with LogDNA instance.

More information on granting access, see [Granting permissions to a user or service ID](/docs/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-iam_view_events).

IBM Cloud account users can monitor account-level operations that are performed on the load balancer service.
{: tip}

To provision an "IBM Cloud Activity Tracker with LogDNA" instance under your account:
1. Log in to the IBM Cloud console. [Log in to IBM Cloud console](https://{DomainName}/){: external}.
2. Click the ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) and select **Observability > Activity Tracker**.
3. Click **Create Instance**.
4. Define a service name.
5. Select `us-south` as the region and choose the resource group
6. Choose a plan other than `lite` if you have a paid account.
7. Click **Create**.

For more information, see the [getting started tutorial for {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-getting-started#getting-started).

Here is the sample activity tracker message for a **Create Listener** operation:
