# Monitoring metrics for IBM VPN for VPC by using {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}
{: #sysdig-monitoring-metrics}

{{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} is operated by Sysdig in partnership with {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} and collects basic VPN metrics on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for VPC, such as VPN gateway status, VPN gateway packets input/output, and VPN connection bytes input/output. These metrics are stored in Sysdig. If you have a Sysdig account, then metrics are displayed for that Sysdig instance. You can access metrics through the prebuilt dashboard.
{:shortdesc}

## Platform metrics overview
{: platform-metrics-overview}

You can view platform metrics when you enable {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} on your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform. A Sysdig instance must be configured in a region to monitor these metrics. For more information, see [Enabling platform metrics](/docs/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Monitoring-with-Sysdig-platform_metrics_enabling).

Before you enable {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} on your platform, keep the following information in mind:

* You can configure only one instance of the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service per region to collect platform metrics.
* Platform metrics are regional. Metrics are monitored only from {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} services, which are in the same region of the instance that you want to monitor.
* Metrics are collected automatically and are available for monitoring through the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}-enabled instance.

## Metrics available by service plan
{: metrics-by-plan}

| Metric name |
|-----------|
| [VPN gateway bytes received](#ibm_is_vpn_gateway_bytes_in) |
| [VPN gateway bytes sent](#ibm_is_vpn_gateway_bytes_out) |
| [VPN gateway packets received](#ibm_is_vpn_gateway_packets_in) |
| [VPN gateway packets sent](#ibm_is_vpn_gateway_packets_out) |
| [VPN gateway status](#ibm_is_vpn_gateway_status) |
| [VPN connection bytes received](#ibm_is_vpn_connection_bytes_in) |

| [VPN connection packets sent](#ibm_is_vpn_connection_packets_out) |
| [VPN connection status](#ibm_is_vpn_connection_status) |
{: caption="Table 1: Metrics available by plan names" caption-side="top"}

These metrics help track the traffic and status for your VPN gateways and can provide insight about peak traffic per minute and overall usage status.

Each metric is composed of the following metadata types:

* Metric name - Name of the collected metric.
* Metric type - Determines whether the metric value is a counter metric or a gauge metric. Each of these metrics is `gauge`type, which represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily fluctuate over time.
* Value type - A unit of measurement for a specific metric. Examples include bytes or counts. A value type of `none` means that the metric value represents individual occurrences of that metric type.
* Segment - How you want Sysdig to divide and display the monitoring metrics.

## Metric segmentation
{: attributes}

You can split the metrics that Sysdig presents into various visualizations in the Sysdig dashboard, allowing views of different metrics based on your preference. For example, if you have multiple VPN gateways or accounts with different VPN gateways in each account, you might want to focus on a particular gateway name.

As an example, you can segment the `VPN Gateway Bytes Input` by `IBM VPN for VPC gateway name` to show how many bytes per minute are received for a VPN gateway through its name. To illustrate this example, let's assume that your account has 10 VPN gateways with different names. The dashboard contains different lines in different colors. Each line represents received bytes per minute for a VPN gateway.


### Global attributes
{: global-attributes-sysdig-vpn}

The following attributes are available for segmenting all of the VPN metrics:

| Attribute | Attribute name | Attribute description |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------------|
| `Cloud type` | `ibm_ctype` | A value of public, dedicated, or local |
| `Location` | `ibm_location` | The location of the monitored resource - a region, data center, or global |
| `Resource` | `ibm_resource` | The resource that is measured by the service - typically an identifying name or GUID |
| `Resource type` | `ibm_resource_type` | The type of resource that is measured by the service |
| `Resource group` | `ibm_resource_group_name` | The resource group where the service instance was created |
| `Scope` | `ibm_scope` | The scope of the account, organization, or space GUID that is associated with this metric |
| `Service name` | `ibm_service_name` | Name of the service that generated this metric |
{: caption="Table 12: VPN metric attributes" caption-side="top"}

### Additional attributes
{: #additional-attributes-sysdig}

The following attributes are available for segmenting one or more attributes as described in the previous reference. See the individual metrics for segmentation options.

| Attribute | Attribute name | Attribute description |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------------|
| `Connection ID` | `ibm_is_vpn_connection_id` | IBM VPN for VPC gateway connection ID |
| `Connection name` | `ibm_is_vpn_connection_name` | IBM VPN for VPC gateway connection name |
| `IBM IS generation 1` | `ibm_is_generation` | IBM IS Generation; for example, 1  |
| `Service instance` | `ibm_service_instance` | Identifies the instance that the metric is associated with |
| `Service instance name` | `ibm_service_instance_name` | Provides the user-provided name of the service instance. This name isn't necessarily a unique value that depends on the name that is provided. |
| `VPN gateway name` | `ibm_is_vpn_gateway_name` | IBM VPN for VPC gateway name |
{: caption="Table 13: VPN segmentation metric attributes" caption-side="top"}

The displayed metrics contain a timestamp in UNIX epoch time and the metric value for the time intervals that end at that timestamp. You can specify different scopes, and the time interval over which to report the metrics.

You can also specify the time interval over which to report your metrics. The following time intervals that are supported in the Sysdig dashboard:

* 10 seconds
* 1 minute
* 10 minutes
* 1 hour
* 6 hours
* 2 weeks
* Custom

## Enabling metrics monitoring
{: #enable-metrics-monitoring}

To receive monitoring metrics, you must set up your {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instance.

To receive monitoring metrics, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [metrics monitoring portal](https://cloud.ibm.com/observe/monitoring) and click **Create a monitoring instance**.

2. Select a region for your Sysdig instance.

   If you do not have an existing VPN gateway, see [Creating a VPN gateway](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-creating-a-vpc-using-the-ibm-cloud-console#creating-a-vpn) to provision one.
   {: tip}

   ![Region](images/metrics_1.png "Region")

   The region needs to match the location of your existing VPN gateway.
   {: important}

3. Choose your pricing plan.

   Pricing plan details are explained in the selection window. Select the plan that best meets your requirements.

4. Provide a unique service name for your instance. The name can be any name that you want. The name has no impact on functionality.

   Do not give multiple Sysdig instances the same name.
   {: important}

5. Optionally, select a resource group. A resource group organizes account resources in customizable groupings. Any account resource that is managed by using IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) access control belongs to a resource group within your account.

   ![Resource group](images/metrics_2.png "Resource group")

   If you do not have any pre-configured resource groups, or have no reason to share this resource selectively, use the default selection.
   {: note}

   If your account has multiple resource groups, you can choose which group has access to this {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instance. By using this selective access, metrics can be available to some resource groups and not to others.
   {: tip}

6. Check the **Enable Platform Metrics** checkbox. You must select this option to receive metrics from your VPN gateway.

7. Click **Create**. You are taken back to the monitoring metrics home page.

Within a few minutes, your new Sysdig instance is displayed with several configurations. You might have to refresh your browser to see it.  

## Working with the Sysdig dashboard

To view and work with your Sysdig metrics, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [metrics monitoring portal](https://cloud.ibm.com/observe/monitoring).

2. Click **View Sysdig** next to the service name of the Sysdig instance that you want to work with.

   The first time that you access your Sysdig instance, several windows display as part of the internal setup. Keep the default entries, and click through the pages until you reach the main Sysdig page.
   {: note}

3. Open the IBM VPN for VPC Monitoring Metrics dashboard by selecting **Dashboards**. 

4. Click **Default Dashboards > IBM > VPC Gen 1 VPN**. The default dashboard is not editable.

5. Ten main metrics in the dashboard are shown. These metrics include Gateway/Connection status, Gateway/Connection bytes input/output, and Gateway/Connection packets input/output. If you want to modify parameters and segment your metrics by VPN gateway name and VPN connection name, you must create a custom dashboard.

   ![VPN Sysdig dashboard](images/dashboard_vpn.png "VPN Sysdig dashboard")

   You can choose what time window that you'd like to see your metrics by using the time selection bar.<!--directional words such as top, bottom, right, left are not to be used - these words violate accessibility standards-->
   {: tip}

## Creating a custom metrics dashboard

You can create your own dashboard to customize your monitoring metrics, such as viewing information about particular VPN gateways, or seeing traffic that comes through only a VPN connection.

To customize your dashboard, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [metrics monitoring portal](https://cloud.ibm.com/observe/monitoring).

2. Click **View Sysdig** next to the service name of the Sysdig instance you want to work with. You now see the dashboard.

3. Select **Dashboards** and click the **+** in the panel.

   ![Add VPN Sysdig dashboard](images/add_dashboard_vpn.png "Add VPN Sysdig dashboard")

4. Select **Blank dashboard** and select the type of visual representation that you want.

   Sysdig offers 8 different visualizations for your dashboard. Read the description for each visualization and choose the one that best meets your requirements.

   **Line** ("View trends over time") is the easiest and most basic option. It is also the most frequently selected option. The examples that are shown here show a line-based visualization.
   {: note}

5. Configure your custom dashboard.

   * In the **Metrics** field, enter `ibm_is` to display the ten IBM Sysdig VPN for VPC metrics: `ibm_is_vpn_gateway_status`, `ibm_is_vpn_connection_status`, `ibm_is_vpn_gateway_bytes_in`, `ibm_is_vpn_gateway_bytes_out`, `ibm_is_vpn_gateway_packets_in`, `ibm_is_vpn_gateway_packets_out`, `ibm_is_vpn_connection_bytes_in`, `ibm_is_vpn_connection_bytes_out`, `ibm_is_vpn_connection_packets_in`, and `ibm_is_vpn_connection_packets_out`.

   * You can choose a scope to display in your dashboard by clicking **Override Dashboard Scope**. For example, you can display the metrics for a particular VPN gateway.

   * You can also set a segment to compare metrics across the scope that you define. For example, you can look at the connection status for a particular VPN gateway that is segmented by gateway name and connection name.

6. Click **Save**.

   By default, the dashboard is named "blank dashboard". You can change the name by selecting **Dashboards** from the sidebar and clicking the Pencil icon next to the name.
   {: tip}

To return to the default Sysdig dashboard at any time, select **Dashboards > Default Dashboards > IBM > VPC Gen 1 VPN**.

## Working with {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} by using APIs
{: #metric-query-api}

You can also work with the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instance by using metric query APIs. You might want to use APIs if you need raw data points or want to consume your metrics from a command-line interface rather than using the Sysdig dashboard.

After you create your {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instance, you must collect the following two pieces of information.

* The Sysdig Monitor API token
* The endpoint of your IBM Cloud Monitoring Sysdig instance

To collect this information and work with your Sysdig instance by using metric query API, follow these steps:

1. Access the [Monitoring home page](https://cloud.ibm.com/observe/monitoring). 

2. Click **View Sysdig** next to the instance that you want to work with. 

3. After the Sysdig dashboard is displayed, select your Account Profile icon on the sidebar and select **Settings**. You now see your account settings.

  ![Settings](images/metrics_settings.png "Settings")

4. Your Sysdig Monitor API token is an alphanumeric string that is located in the **Sysdig Monitor API Token** field. Click the **Copy** button to copy the token to your clipboard.

    Do not share this API token. Anyone who has this API token has full access to your metrics.
    {: important}

5. To get the endpoint of your IBM Cloud Monitoring Sysdig instance, go to your main Sysdig dashboard in your browser. Then, select the URL to the dashboard, which appears similar to this example:

  ```
  https://us-south.monitoring.cloud.ibm.com/#/default-dashboard/ibm_vpc_vpn_gen1?last=1209600
  ```

  The first part of the URL (in this example, `us-south.monitoring.cloud.ibm.com`) is your endpoint. Make note of this URL.

6. After you have both the API token and the endpoint, you can format your POST request. The following POST request is an example, with all the parameters that you can modify. The following are parameters:

  * The Sysdig Monitor API token.
  * The endpoint of your Sysdig instance.
  * The value for `ibm_is_vpn_gateway_name` (the VPN gateway name that you want to see metrics for).

   If you want to see this metric for all of your VPN gateways, do not enter a value for the `scope` attribute. For example, use `"scope” : “”`.
   {: note}

  * The metric type that you want to see the results for. This example uses `ibm_is_vpn_gateway_status`.
  * The `from` and `to` attributes define the timeframe to focus the scan, set in Epoch Time, and in microseconds.
  * The `sampling` and `value` attributes set the granularity of the data that is returned in the POST request.

   Because a large volume of data is stored in Sysdig, choosing the specific level of granularity is important. Sysdig can return only 600 data points at a time per request. As a result, the `sampling` and `value` attributes are important. Leaving these two lines out of your request returns an aggregate sum over that time period instead.

   If the time range that is specified by `from` and `to` is large (for example, 4 days), but you define a `sampling` and `value` of 10 seconds, meaning that you receive 4 days worth of data that is split into 10-second chunks. This sample is not useful because of the large amount of data that is returned. Specifying a larger chunk is recommended (for example, 1 hour instead of 10 seconds).
