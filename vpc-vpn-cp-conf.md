# Creating a secure connection with a remote Check Point Security Gateway peer
{: #conn-checkpoint-peer}

You can connect a Check Point Security Gateway peer to a VPN gateway in an existing {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
{: shortdesc}

These examples are based on Check Point Security Gateway, Software Release [R80.10].
{: note}

## Topology
{: #checkpoint-architecture}

The following diagram shows a VPN gateway in an IBM Cloud VPC connecting to a Check Point Security Gateway peer.

## Configuring the Check Point Security Gateway peer
{: #create-conn-checkpoint-peer}

Check Point Security Gateway uses IKEv1 by default, you must create a custom [IKE](#custom-ike-policy-with-cp) and [IPsec](#custom-ipsec-policy-with-cp) policy to replace the default policy for the VPN in your VPC. 

The following parameters are used in the Check Point Security Gatewayâ€™s example VPN configuration. Update the values as you see fit.
{: #VPN-Parameters}

|   Parameters     | Value |
| ------- | ------ |
| IKE version | IKEv1|    
| IKE policy | AES256-SHA1-Group2 |
| IPsec policy | AES128-SHA1 |
| IKE lifetime | 1440 minutes |
| IPsec lifetime | 3600 seconds |
| DPD | dpd action is restart |

**To support these functions, the following general configuration steps must be performed by the Check Point Security Gateway:**

1. Configure the Security Gateways that are internally managed
  * Go to **SmartConsole\>Securitys & Services** and click on the name of Security Gateway to open the Security Gateway configuration page.
  * Go to **Network Management** page to define the Topology.
  * Go to **Network Management \> VPN Domain** to define the VPN Domain.
2. Create an `Interoperable Device` on the Check Point SmartConsole
  * Go to Object Explorer and click **New \> Network Object \> More \> Interoperable Device** to open the new interoperable page.
  * In the **General Properties** page, enter IBM VPN gateway name and public IP address.
  * Go to **Topology page**, add IBM VPN gateway public IP address and IBM VPC subnets. The IBM VPN public IP address should be added as external network with netmask `255.255.255.255`. The IBM VPC subnets should be added as internal network.
3. Add VPN Community, the instructions below are based on that a `Star Community` was chosen, but a `Meshed Community` is an option as well.
  * Go to **SmartConsole \> Security Policies \> Access Tools \> VPN Communities** and click on `Star Community` to open the new VPN community page.
  * Enter the new Community name.
  * Go to **Gateways \> Center Gateways** page, click the `+` icon and add Check Point Security Gateway.
  * Go to **Gateways \> Satellite Gateways** page, click the `+` icon and add the IBM VPN gateway.
  * Go to **Encryption** page, use default `Encryption Method` and `Encryption Suite`.
  * Go to **Tunnel Management** page, select `One VPN tunnel per subnet pair`.
  * Go to **Shared Secret page**, set the pre-share key.
  * Click OK and publish the changes.
4. Add relevant access rules in the Security Policy
  * Add the Community in the VPN column, the services in the Service & Applications column, the desired Action, and the appropriate Track option.
  * Install the Access Control Policy.

### Creating a custom IKE policy for Check Point Security Gateway
{: #custom-ike-policy-with-cp}

By default, Check Point Security Gateway uses IKEv1, therefore, you must create a custom IKE policy to replace the default policy for the VPN in your VPC.

To use a custom IKE policy in VPN for VPC:
1. On the VPN for VPC page in the IBM Cloud console, select the **IKE policies** tab.
2. Click **New IKE policy** and specify the following values:
  * For the **IKE Version** field, select **1**.
  * For the **Authentication** field, select **sha1**.
  * For the **Encryption** field, select **aes256**.
  * For the **DH Group** field, select **2**.
  * For the **Key lifetime** field, specify **86400**.
3. When you create the VPN connection in your VPC, select this custom IKE policy.

### Creating a custom IPsec policy for Check Point Security Gateway
{: #custom-ipsec-policy-with-cp}

To use a custom IPsec policy in VPN for VPC:
1. On the VPN for VPC page in the IBM Cloud console, select the **IPsec policies** tab.
2. Click **New IPsec policy** and specify the following values:
  * For the **Authentication** field, select **sha1**.
  * For the **Encryption** field, select **aes128**.
  * For the **Key lifetime** field, specify **3600**.
3. When you create the VPN connection in your VPC, select this custom IPsec policy.

## Checking the status of the secure connection
{: #check-cp-conn-status}

You can check the status of your connection in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. On the VPN for VPC page, select your VPN gateway and click **Connections** from the navigation pane on the left side of the page.

You can also test the connection by doing a ping from a virtual server instance in your VPC to a server in the on-premises network.
